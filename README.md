# Dex223 listings

[Dex223](https://www.dex223.io/) is a decentralized exchange supporting ERC-20 and ERC-223 tokens, compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine. Dex223 supports three methods of token listings: (1) default tokens list reviewed by the team, (2) tokenlists.org and (3) auto-listing contracts.

Dex223 features "trust score" system which displays to the user the likelihood of a token to be suspicious. Tokens listed to the default token list have significant trust score bonuses.

This repository will be used to manage the application process for new tokens to be included in the default token list.
